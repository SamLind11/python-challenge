Python challenge assignment for Data Analytics Bootcamp.

# Description

For this assignment, there are two folders, PyBank and PyPoll.  The main.py in **PyBank** reads from a csv file in the Resources folder which tracks financial records of a company.  The script analyzes the data and prints results to the terminal, and creates a txt. file containing the analysis (stored in the "analysis" folder).  The main.py in **PyPoll** reads from a csv file in the Resources folder which contains votes from a local election.  The script tallies the votes and declares a winner.  Again, results are printed to both the terminal and a txt. file in the analysis folder.
